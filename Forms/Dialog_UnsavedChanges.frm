'Unsaved Changes Dialog
'Copyright 2011-2024 by Tanner Helland

'Last update: removed the DrawSystemIcon sub; now it can be found in the "Drawing" module
'
'Custom dialog box for warning the user that they are about to close an image with unsaved changes.
'
'This form was built after much usability testing.  There are many bad ways to design a save prompt,
' and only a few good ones.  I felt that descriptive icons were necessary to help the user quickly
' determine what choice to make.  A preview of the image in question is also displayed, to make it
' absolutely certain that the user is not confused about which image they're dealing with.  (This is
' important for photos from a digital camera, which often have names like "1004701.jpg".) Very
' descriptive tooltip text has also been added, and I genuinely believe that this is one of the best
' unsaved changes dialogs available.
'
'Finally, note that this prompt can be turned off completely from the Edit -> Preferences menu.
