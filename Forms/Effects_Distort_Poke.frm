'I'm not sold on the "poke" moniker for this tool, but I couldn't come up with a better visualization for how
' the tool works.  When I use it, I envision an imaginary finger poking through the screen.  :)
'
'While this may look similar to the "Pinch" component of "Pinch and Whirl", there are some differences that make
' this algorithm worth separate inclusion.  Most important is the way it handles values > 1 - this algorithm will
' actually bend the corner edges to match, which makes it capable of correcting certain types of image distortion.
' (GIMP relies heavily on this in its own lens correction algorithm.)
'
'Supersampling and reverse-mapping interpolation are available for very high-quality output.
'
'The transformation used by this tool is a heavily modified version of basic math originally shared by Paul Bourke.
