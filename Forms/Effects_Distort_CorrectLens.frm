'Fix Lens Distort Tool
'Copyright 2013-2024 by Tanner Helland
'Created: 22/January/13
'Last updated: 21/February/20
'Last update: large performance improvements
'
'This tool allows the user to correct an existing lens distortion on an image.  Bilinear interpolation
' (via reverse-mapping) is available for a higher quality correction.
'
'A zoom parameter is also provided to help the user determine how much of the image they are willing
' to sacrifice as part of the correction.  If the distort is quite high, there is no real way to
' correct the image without cutting off parts of it (see sample images at http://photo.net/learn/fisheye/).
'
'For optimal quality, I suggest zooming out a ways, applying the correction, then cropping the resultant
' image to the desired shape.
