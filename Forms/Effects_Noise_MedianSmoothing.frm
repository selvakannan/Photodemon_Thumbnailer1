'Median Filter Tool
'Copyright 2013-2024 by Tanner Helland
'Created: 08/Feb/13
'Last updated: 23/June/20
'Last update: as median radius increases, use an increasingly strong wavelet approximation.
'              This provides large (100x+) improvements to performance at large (100px+) radii.
'
'This is a heavily optimized median filter function.  An "accumulation" technique is used instead
' of the standard sliding window mechanism.
' (See http://web.archive.org/web/20060718054020/http://www.acm.uiuc.edu/siggraph/workshops/wjarosz_convolution_2001.pdf)
' This allows the algorithm to perform extremely well, despite being written in pure VB.
'
'That said, it is still unfortunately slow in the IDE.  I STRONGLY recommend compiling before
' applying any median filter(s).
'
'An optional percentile option is available.  At minimum value, this performs identically to an
' erode (minimum) filter.  Similarly, at max value it performs identically to a dilate (maximum)
' filter.  Default setting is 50%.
'
'To improve performance at very large radii, a wavelet approximation is automatically enabled as
' radius increases.  On e.g. an 8-megapixel photo, this reduces running time of a 100px median filter
' from ~160 seconds to ~7 seconds, and produces an image that is 99.86% identical to a "true" median
' (measured using PD's built-in RMSD tool).

            'Wavelets (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wavelet) are an old-school signal-processing
            ' approach.  Basically, you can represent any wave by breaking it down into a series of
            ' waves with different wavelengths and amplitudes, which - when added together -
            ' precisely reproduce the original wave.  This is very similar in concept to Fourier
            ' transforms (which are specifically sine waves) and DCTs (cosine waves).
            
            'In image processing, wavelets are typically copies of the image at different sizes,
            ' with each size representing a different level of detail.  You can modify different
            ' "wavelets" to isolate higher- or lower-frequency noise.
            
            'Per it's name, the median filter affects all frequencies with increasing strength
            ' as the radius of the effect increases.  This means that there's little point in
            ' wasting energy on high-frequency noise at large radii, as the whole point of a
            ' median filter is to *ignore* high-frequency noise.  So as median filter radius
            ' increases, we can operate on a smaller copy of the image with minimal data loss,
            ' provided we...
            ' 1) scale the wavelet size at an appropriate rate for median radius changes, and...

            '    inadvertently introduce new noise.

            ' (1) was tackled by good old-fashioned trial-and-error.  I sampled a half-dozen
            ' images at various sizes and median radii, then tested how aggressively I could
            ' downsample them while still retaining roughly 99.9% accuracy.  I fit the resulting
            ' settings to a curve and tweaked it against expected image sizes (e.g. PD can only
