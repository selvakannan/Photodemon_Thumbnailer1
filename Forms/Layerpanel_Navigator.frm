'
'As part of the 7.0 release, PD's right-side panel gained a lot of new functionality.  To simplify the code for
' the new panel, each chunk of related settings (e.g. layer, nav, color selector) was moved to its own subpanel.
'
'This form is the subpanel for the navigator/overview panel.
'
'The most interesting object on this form is the navigator user control, which synchronizes with the viewport to
' allow the user to quickly move around the image regardless of zoom.
