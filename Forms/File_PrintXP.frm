'Last update: restructure this horrifying dialog into something slightly less horrifying... and remove a bunch of
'             VB picture boxes while I'm at it.
'
'Still needs: Internal paper size support via EnumForms.  At present, PageSetupDlg is used to handle paper size, but it's
'              an inelegant solution at best.  One of its biggest problems is that it doesn't restrict page sizes to ones
'              supported by a given printer.  Lame.  The best solution would be a custom-built page-select feature that
'              doesn't require the user to spawn an additional window just to change paper sizes.
'              Note that in XP+, Windows no longer allows the Printer object to set arbitrary width and height values.
'              Programs must adhere to existing page sizes as specified by EnumForms, and if they *do* decide to add custom
'              forms, they must add them to the registry so all applications can access them.  It's a mess.  That said, here
'              are some resources that may help if I ever decide to implement paper size in the future:
