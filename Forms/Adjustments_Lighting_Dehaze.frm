'
'Automatic image dehazing is an area of active study.  It is of special interest to automative manufacturers,
' who need access to fast, high-quality dehazing algorithms for automative safety system cameras.
'
'PD's implementation is currently based on a 2018 paper in the open-access journal "Mathematical Problems in
' Engineering" by Zhong Luan, Hao Zeng, Yuanyuan Shang, Zhuhong Shao, and Hui Ding.  The paper is titled
' "Fast Video Dehazing Using Per-Pixel Minimum Adjustment" and you can you download it here (link good as of
' September 2021): https://www.hindawi.com/journals/mpe/2018/9241629/
'
'Many thanks to Zhong Luan et al for sharing their work under a Creative Commons Attribution License.
'
'I read quite a few dehazing papers from the past two decades before settling on this one for PhotoDemon's
' implementation.  One of the biggest issues I have in PD development is implementing methods that meet a
' few strict criteria:
' 1) no massive 3rd-party libraries (e.g. OpenCV is out) or amd64-only libraries
' 2) good run-time performance without modern intrinsics, including SIMD (necessary for XP compatibility)
' 3) better performance than O(n^2) because considering (1) and (2), I still have to make the function fast
'    enough to be useable on 20+ megapixel photos, even on PCs with strong RAM/CPU limitations.
'
'These criteria get harder to meet every year, especially as I attempt to add things to PD beyond the usual
' low-hanging photo editing fruit of brightness, contrast, etc.
'
'Anyway, I liked this paper because most dehazing approaches rely on either massive regional analysis on each
' pixel (which is incredibly slow), optimizing lengthy differential equations on-the-fly (which is even worse),
' or machine-learning algorithms that require huge training sets (ugh no).  For example, this link describes
' a classical dehaze implementation based on the original dark-channel prior theory by Kaiming He:
' - https://sites.google.com/site/computervisionadinastoica/final-project
' As the authors at that link state: "Running the algorithm on any larger images would require days of
' computation... He, Sun, and Tang mentioned using the Preconditioned Conjugate Gradient algorithm as a solver,
' allowing them to process a 600x400 pixel image in roughly 10-20 seconds."
'
'10-20 seconds for a 600x400 image!  Not gonna work for PhotoDemon.
'
'Convesely, the paper by Zhong Luan et al uses a much-simpler per-pixel analysis with good - and predictable! -
' results, excellent performance, low memory requirements, and many areas of potential further optimization
' that play nicely with VB6's limitations.  Using this strategy, a 10-megapixel image processes in less than a
' second, regardless of inputs.  Much better.
'
'As such, while this work is heavily inspired by the original paper, it is *not* identical.  (Nothing built
' in VB ever is lol.)  I have heavily commented the code to note deliberate modifications and/or enhancements,
' and I am open to input on further changes.  As with other functions in PD, I generally try to err on the side
' of "more subtle, useful real-world results" vs "intense HDR-style changes" that look impressive in a paper
' but produce wildly unrealistic-looking results on things like regular iPhone photos.
