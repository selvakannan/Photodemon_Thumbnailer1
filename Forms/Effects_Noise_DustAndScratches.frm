            ' approach.  Basically, you can represent any wave by breaking it down into a series of
            ' waves with different wavelengths and amplitudes, which - when added together -
            ' precisely reproduce the original wave.  This is very similar in concept to Fourier
            ' transforms (which are specifically sine waves) and DCTs (cosine waves).
            
            'In image processing, wavelets are typically copies of the image at different sizes,
            ' with each size representing a different level of detail.  You can modify different

            ' as the radius of the effect increases.  This means that there's little point in
            ' wasting energy on high-frequency noise at large radii, as the whole point of a
            ' median filter is to *ignore* high-frequency noise.  So as median filter radius
            ' increases, we can operate on a smaller copy of the image with minimal data loss,
            ' provided we...
            ' 1) scale the wavelet size at an appropriate rate for median radius changes, and...
            ' 2) use appropriate sampling techniques to ensure the wavelet approach doesn't
            '    inadvertently introduce new noise.
            
            '(2) is easily covered by using smart resampling settings already built in to PD.

            ' images at various sizes and median radii, then tested how aggressively I could
            ' downsample them while still retaining roughly 99.9% accuracy.  I fit the resulting
            ' settings to a curve and tweaked it against expected image sizes (e.g. PD can only
