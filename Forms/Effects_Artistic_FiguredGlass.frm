'Image "Figured Glass" Distortion
'Copyright 2013-2024 by Tanner Helland
'Created: 08/January/13
'Last updated: 20/February/20
'Last update: large performance optimizations
'
'This tool allows the user to apply a distort operation to an image that mimicks seeing it
' through warped glass, perhaps glass tiles of some sort.  Many different names are used for
' this effect - Paint.NET calls it "dents" (which I quite dislike); other software calls it
' "marbling".  I chose figured glass because it's an actual type of uneven glass - see:
' https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Architectural_glass#Rolled_plate_.28figured.29_glass
'
'As with other distorts in the program, bilinear interpolation (via reverse-mapping) and
' optional supersampling are available for those who desire very a high-quality transformation.
'
'Unlike other distorts, no radius is required for this effect.  It always operates on the
' entire image/selection.
'
'Finally, the transformation used by this tool is a modified version of a transformation
