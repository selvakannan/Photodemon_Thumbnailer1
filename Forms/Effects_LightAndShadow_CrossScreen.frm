'Cross-screen filters are physical filters placed over the lens of a camera:
' https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photographic_filter#Cross_screen
'
'Different diffraction patterns in the lens create stars of varying spoke counts in regions where lighting is strong.
'
'Finding a digital replacement for a filter like this is tough; in fact, the only one I've seen is a $50 plugin for
' PhotoShop.  (http://www.scarablabs.com/star-filter-photoshop)  I haven't actually tested that solution, so I can't
' vouch for its performance or quality, but given the rarity of digital versions of this filter, I have to think
' others have run into problems creating their own.  (Which of course, makes our version that much sweeter!  ;)
'
'Performance is pretty good, all things considered, but be careful in the IDE.  As usual, I STRONGLY recommend compiling
' before using this tool.
'
'Note also that this filter wraps a motion-blur-ish effect.  PD has multiple rotation engines available, and after some
' profiling, I've decided to go with GDI+ for this filter.  It's fast and of sufficient quality, but in case we need
' to revisit this decision in the future, I've left the engine code for FreeImage and our own internal PD method as well.
