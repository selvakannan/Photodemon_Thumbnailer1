'Last updated: 01/October/21
'Last update: add support for WebP as a target format (in addition to existing APNG support)
'
'PD can write both animated PNGs and animated WebP files.  These formats are a great fit
' for animated screen captures (24-bit color!).  PhotoDemon provides a rudimentary screen
' recorder that can dump frames directly to either format, or cache them internally for
' subsequent loading into PhotoDemon (as a generic animated image container which you can then
' export however you want, even to GIF with all its limitations).
