'Image "Spherize" Distortion
'Copyright 2013-2024 by Tanner Helland
'Created: 05/June/13
'Last updated: 20/February/20
'Last update: large performance improvements
'
'This tool allows the user to map an image around a sphere, with optional rotation and bidirectional offsets.
' Supersampling and reverse-mapped interpolation are available to improve mapping quality.
'
'In keeping with the true mathematical nature of spheres, this tool forces x and y mapping to the minimum
' dimension (width or height).  Technically this isn't necessary, as the code works just fine with rectangular
' shapes, but as my lens distort tool already handles rectangular shapes, I'm forcing this one to spheres only.
'
'For a bit of extra fun, the empty space around the sphere can be mapped one of two ways - as light rays "beaming"
' from behind the sphere, or simply erased to white.  Your choice.
'
'The transformation used by this tool is a heavily modified version of an equation originally shared by Paul Bourke.
' You can see Paul's original (and very helpful article) at the following link, good as of 05 June '13:
