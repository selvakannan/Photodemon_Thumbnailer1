'Last update: split into its own class, so that tools other than the plain paintbrush can use it!
'
'This module handles the messy business of translating mouse events (or really, a list of input
' coordinates) into a stream of paint dabs.
'
'All of PD's paint tools rely on this class in some way.
'
'The class uses a simple design:
' 1) As the caller receives input events, it should forward them to this class
' 2) This class will use the current brush settings to calculate a corresponding list of dabs
' 3) Based on brush settings, a matching "list of dabs" will be returned back to the caller
' 4) The caller can apply those dabs however they want!
