'Undo/Redo Handler
'Copyright 2001-2024 by Tanner Helland
'Created: 2/April/01
'Last updated: 26/April/19
'Last update: modify File > Revert behavior; it now creates a *new* entry on the Undo stack (similar to Photoshop),
'             which allows the user to return to previous states even after reverting.
'
'PhotoDemon has had Undo/Redo capabilities for a long time.  The first incarnation (way back in 2001) stored a single
' byte-array copy of the image in RAM, allowing for a lone Undo step if necessary.  Eventually this was converted
' to a more robust HDD-based solution, and further updates have tacked on features to (the very poor) original
' Undo/Redo framework.
'
'In 2013, I finally had enough of the program's shoddy Undo/Redo code, so I merged all the various Undo/Redo subs
' into a single class, and gave each pdImage a copy of said class.  As part of the rewrite, the Undo/Redo engine
' itself was rewritten in a much cleaner fashion, including moving all interface-related code outside the class.
' (Specifically, UI considerations were handed off to PD's central SyncInterfaceToCurrentImage function.)
'
'In 2014, as part of adding Layers support, the Undo/Redo engine was further modified from a lazy implementation to
' an active one.  What does this mean?  Basically, the previous "lazy" implementation did not create Undo/Redo data
' until absolutely necessary (e.g. after at least one image-changing action had been initiated, and right before a
' new action was about to occur).  Such an ultra-conservative approach had benefits; for example, Undo data was
' never created until an image was actually edited, improving image load time, and Redo data was never created
' unless Undo was actually pressed.  While good for conserving memory, this system ultimately proved untenable, as it
' required a lot of special handling re: "what happened previously", which was necessary for handling Undo creation
' correctly for odd edge cases (like when an image edit is applied after a selection modification). To simplify the
' engine and make it capable of storing Undo/Redo data other than just the full pdImage stack, the engine was
' converted to an Active implementation.  Now, any time the image is modified, Undo data is immediately written
' to file following the completion of the modification action.
'
'Similarly, when an image is first loaded, a full backup of the image is immediately written to a temp file.  This
' incurs a slight penalty in load-time performance, but I believe the trade-off is worth it because this backup file
' is also useful for the Autosave engine, as it gives us something to work from in the event of an unsafe shutdown.
'
'Later in 2014, writing a full pdImage stack for each program action proved a terrible idea, due to the size,
' slowness, and complexity of each Undo/Redo file.  To combat this, the Undo/Redo engine was rewritten yet again -
' but this time, as a full-featured "diff engine", not unlike what powers Git.  Specifically, PD's Undo/Redo engine
' now saves only the minimum amount of data necessary to reconstruct an image from its immediately previous Undo/Redo
' entry.  This allows for very small Undo/Redo files, at a trade-off with a large amount of new complexity in the
' Undo/Redo engine itself.  I believe this approach is the best one possible, so I'm hoping 2014 marks the end of
' massive Undo/Redo engine rewrites.  (Fingers crossed.)
'
'Undo/Redo data is still saved to the HDD, and will remain that way for the forseeable future.  Unlimited operations
' are allowed.  This class does not check HDD space availability, so errors may be thrown if the user runs out of free
' space.  Similarly, clearing the specified TEMP folder in the middle of program operation is a bad idea.  PD will not
' crash (probably), but as expected, Undo/Redo functionality will stop working.
