'Copyright 2021-2024 by Tanner Helland
'Created: 01/November/21
'Last updated: 05/December/21
'Last update: new support function to retrieve the flyout screen rectangle; selection tools use
'             this to auto-hide flyout panels if they intersect with the current mouse position
'
'Controller for flyout panels from PD's (many) toolboxes.
'
'Toolboxes were originally located at the bottom of the screen - a hasty decision made years ago,
' before PD had any on-canvas tools.  (Only selection tools existed back then.)  As new canvas tools
' were added, the old toolbox design grew more and more unwieldy, and as the need for complex tools
' increased, there simply wasn't any way to do it with the old design.
'
'So in 2021 I bit the bullet and redesigned all toolpanels completely.  Instead of a using a large
' fixed height for all panels, they were converted to a much shorter design with flyout panels that
' automatically engage if any of their constituent controls receive focus.  Tab design is also
' manually handled on these panels to ensure intuitive behavior.
'
'This new design required a new class to handle the details of flyout show/hide behavior, since it
' requires manually modifying a bunch of window bits (without using different forms for every
' subpanel - which would require hundreds of new forms!).
'
'Note that this class also provides some flyout helper functions (like redraw state trackers)
' which are *not* used by this class directly, but are used by toolbox instances to prevent
' things like recursive redraws when swapping between panels.
