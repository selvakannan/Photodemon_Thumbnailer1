'IMRUList : Interface for Recent File (MRU) lists
'Copyright 2005-2024 by Raj Chaudhuri and Tanner Helland
'Created: 16/February/15
'Last updated: 17/February/15
'Last updated by: Raj
'Last update: GetThumbnailPath returns a string
'Dependencies: - pdMRUManager (helper class that manages the XML storage of MRU entries).  Note that pdMRUManager has several
'                 dependencies of its own; those are not listed here, for brevity's sake.
'              - pdImage (for lists where thumbnail images are relevant)
'
'This interface provides properties and methods to deal with the non-generic parts of MRU maintainence, such as the path to
' the XML file where the MRU would be saved, and points in time when the UI needs to be updated. See pdMRURecentFiles.cls
' for a sample implementation.
