'Newer Windows versions expose some neat features (like progress bars overlaying the taskbar), and PhotoDemon
' tries to make use of them when relevant.  Similarly, some OS-level features are not easily mimicked from within VB
' (like Unicode-aware command-line processing), and I've tried to encapsulate those features here.
'
'The thunks used for Win 7+ taskbar integration are based off AndRAY's original implementation here:
