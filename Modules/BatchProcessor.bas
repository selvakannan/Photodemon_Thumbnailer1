'Created: 10/21/01
'Last updated: 27/October/21
'Last update: merge all validation into one place, and add an explicit check for "Original image state"

'
'This (relatively small) sub handles all macro-related operations.  Macros are simply a recorded list
' of program operations, which can be "played back" to automate complex image processing actions.
'
'To create a macro, the user current has two options:
' 1) They can "record" themselves applying a series of actions to an image.
' 2) They can retroactively create a macro from a list of operations they've applied during this session.
'
'Either way, a list of specific actions will be exported to file, and that file can then be re-played
' against any image in the future.
'
'PhotoDemon's batch processing wizard has an integrated "play macro on image" tool, so that any combination
' of actions can be applied to any combination of images automatically.  This is a trademark feature of
' the program.
'
'As of 2014, the macro engine has been rewritten in significant ways.  Macros now rely on PhotoDemon's
' new string-based parameter design, and all macro settings are saved as XML files.  This makes them
' human-readable and human-editable, but it also means that old macro files are no longer supported.
' Users of old macro files are automatically warned of this change if they try to load an outdated
' macro file.
