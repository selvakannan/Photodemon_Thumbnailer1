'Last update: new func for wrapping a signed short array around arbitrary pointers (for HGT import)
'
'PhotoDemon relies on a lot of "not officially sanctioned" VB6 behavior to enable various optimizations
' and C-style code techniques. If a function's primary purpose is a VB6-specific workaround, I prefer to
' move it here instead of cluttering purposeful modules with obscure, VB-specific hackery.
'
'Note that some code here may seem redundant (e.g. identical functions suffixed by data type, instead of
' declared "As Any") but that's by design - e.g. to improve safety since these techniques are almost
' always crash-prone if used incorrectly or imprecisely.
'
'A number of the techniques in this module were devised with help from Karl E. Peterson's work at
' http://vb.mvps.org/ - thank you, Karl!
