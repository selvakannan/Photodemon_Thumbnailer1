'Last update: start splitting relevant bits from pdFont into this separate manager module.
'              pdFont still exists for GDI font rendering purposes.
'
'For many years, PhotoDemon has used the pdFont class for GDI text rendering.  Unfortunately, that class
' was designed before I knew much about GDI font management, and it has some sketchy design considerations
' that make it a poor fit for PD's text tool.
'
'As part of a broader overhaul to PD's text management, this new Fonts module has been created.  Its job
' is to manage a font cache for this system, which individual font classes can then query for things like
' font existence, style, and more.
'
'Obviously, this class relies heavily on WAPI.  Functions are documented to the best of my knowledge and ability.
