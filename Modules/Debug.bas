'Created: 17/July/14
'Last updated: 08/March/18
'Last update: rework initialization to allow us to arbitrarily start/suspend the debugger during a given session
'Dependencies: OS module (for retrieving system-level debug data)
'
'As PhotoDemon has grown more complex, debugging has become correspondingly difficult.  Debugging on my local PC is fine
' thanks to the IDE, but a lot of behaviors are different in the compiled .exe, and user PCs are another problem entirely.
'
'To that end, a more comprehensive debugging solution was required.  Enter this class.
'
'Throughout PD, you'll see many pdDebug.LogAction() statements in place of Debug.Print.  When actions are logged this way,
' they are mirrored to the Debug window (same as Debug.Print), and also be written out to file in the program's /Data
' folder (if user preferences allow).  This allows me to retrieve relevant information from users who experience crashes.
'
'While some elements of this class are PD-specific (such as where it writes its logs to file), it wouldn't take much
' work to change those bits to fit any other project.  Aside from that particular aspect, I've tried to keep the rest
' of the class as generic as possible in case this is helpful to others.
