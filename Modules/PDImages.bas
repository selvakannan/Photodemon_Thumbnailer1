'Created: 11/29/02
'Last updated: 03/December/18
'Last update: separate from the old canvas handler, and fully integrate the old bare "m_PDImages()" array
'             behind safe wrapper functions.
'
'In "ye good ol' days", PhotoDemon exposed the collection of currently loaded user images as a bare array.
' This was a terrible idea (for too many reasons to count).
'
'These days, the open image collection is instead managed by this module.  This provides much more
' flexibility in how we manage the collection "behind-the-scenes", with improved options for tasks
' like memory management (e.g. suspending inactive images to disk).
