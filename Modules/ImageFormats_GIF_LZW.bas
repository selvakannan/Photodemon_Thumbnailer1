'Last update: enable LZW heuristics for improved compression ratios
'
'In 2021, I spent some time optimizing PhotoDemon's animated GIF exporter.  Many optimizations
' occur before actual GIF encoding (frame- and palette-related stuff), but for final GIF encoding
' I leaned on the 3rd-party FreeImage library.  Unfortunately, FreeImage's GIF support is mediocre
' (palettes are always written as 256-color tables, encoding is built atop strings (!!!) so perf
' is rough), so I started hunting for alternative solutions.
'
'After getting angry at giflib and the incredibly unpleasant shitshow that is compiling it as
' a Windows DLL, I stumbled across a VB6 LZW encoder at the planet-source-code archive on GitHub:
'
'https://github.com/Planet-Source-Code/carles-p-v-image-8-bpp-ditherer-native-gif-encoder__1-45899
'
'Carles's project is a modified version of a VB6 LZW implementation originally by Ron van Tilburg:
'
'https://github.com/Planet-Source-Code/ron-van-tilburg-rvtvbimg__1-14210/blob/master/GIFSave.bas
'
'Per the comments in his code, Ron translated his initial version from C sources derived from the
' original UNIX compress.c.  It was a fun trip down memory lane to see some familiar PSC authors,
' but as always, there's a critical problem with VB6 code from public archives like this -
' the likelihood of the code being exhaustively stress-tested (for performance, security,
' reliability, etc) is... not so likely.
'
'Fortunately, the original C sources for compress.c are still available, as are translations into
' myriad other languages - for example, a few seconds on GitHub turned up these:
' https://github.com/mlapadula/GifEncoder/blob/master/lib/src/main/java/com/mlapadula/gifencoder/LzwEncoder.java
' https://github.com/P1ayer4312/Steam-Artwork-Cropper/blob/main/steam/js/gif.js-master/src/LZWEncoder.js
'
'Armed with multiple references to compare and contrast, I set about mixing and matching the
' original C code with some ideas from Carles/Ron's VB6 versions to produce something appropriate
' for PhotoDemon.  I think the final result is very good, with meaningfully improved performance,
' a number of fixed edge-case bugs, reworking of various suboptimal-for-VB6 designs, and improved
' LZW encoding efficiency.  The final result is a very compact LZW encoder with efficiency and
' performance on par with giflib, and pretty much on-par with the original compress.c version.
'
'Note that this module only handles the LZW encoding portion of GIF export.  All the actual file
' encoding (including headers, tables, etc) is 100% my own work and it remains in the
' ImageFormats_GIF module under the same BSD license as PD itself.  I've deliberately moved this
' LZW code into its own file because the 40-year copyright list is quite long, and licensing is
' murky because while compress.c was released into the public domain, the licensing state of
' subsequent translations is unclear.  For commercial usage you may want to contact some of the
' authors listed below for clarity, but please consider any modifications I've made to be freely
' licensed in the public domain under the unlicense (https://unlicense.org/).

'GIF's LZW variant has specific requirements.  12-bits is the longest allowable LZW code,

'To enable compression heuristics (which attempt to clear the LZW code table at "ideal" intervals),
' set this value >= 0.  The current design requires the value to be of the form (2^n - 1), because it
' uses AND masking to mark intervals.
Private Const ENABLE_HEURISTICS As Long = 255

'Same as ENABLE_HEURISTICS, above, but specifically designed for the special case of
' "after the LZW code table fills".  The way the GIF format is designed, you only get 4096 unique
' LZW values before you need to clear the table and start over - but you don't *have* to start over
' at that point.  You can continue using the current table as-is, without adding new entries to it.
' Because resetting the table also resets your current compression ratio, each block has a
' "sweet spot" where the current table is still doing better work than a reset would provide -
' but you have to test for this state using heuristics, because the "sweet spot" varies wildly from
' block to block.
'
'When set to 0, the table always clears immediately after it reaches capacity, (which is the behavior
' most GIF encoders use).
Private Const ENABLE_HEURISTICS_FULL As Long = 31

'Name says it all: starts at 9 for 8-bpp data (because 8 bits are reserved for standard values [0-255])
' and increases as table fills.  Smaller palettes start at the nearest power-of-two of their palette size,

'
' "A special Clear code is defined which resets all compression/decompression parameters and
' tables to a start-up state... The Clear code can appear at any point in the image data stream
' and therefore requires the LZW algorithm to process succeeding codes as if a new data stream
' was starting. Encoders should output a Clear code as the first code of each image data stream."

Private LZW_EOF_CODE As Long

Private m_freeEntry As Long

'A major limitation of ZLW encoding is the fixed maximum size of the code table.  When the table
' is filled, there's no way to remove elements from it - you have to flush the entire table and
' start over from scratch.  (Contrast this with LZ77's "sliding window" which doesn't use a table;
' instead it uses references to previous points in the stream, which means data automatically
' "falls out of scope" as the window slides across the data.)

' initial bit-size of codes.)
Private m_tableJustCleared As Boolean

'Initial length of output codes varies according to the underlying palette size.  8-bit palettes
' must start at 9-bits, but smaller palettes are allowed to start at a smaller level (and thus
' have more room in their table before filling it).  From the GIF spec:
'
' "The output codes are of variable length, starting at <code size>+1 bits per code, up to 12 bits
' per code. This defines a maximum code value of 4095 (0xFFF). Whenever the LZW code value would
' exceed the current code length, the code length is increased by one. The packing/unpacking of

' index into the mask array, among other things.)

'GIF's LZW implementation requires you to flush collected codes out to file in 255-byte

Private m_dstStream As pdStream

'We use heuristics to improve encoding efficiency.  If efficiency starts trending downward
' (we check it on every sub-block write, and look for two consecutive "worsening" blocks),
' it's almost always better to just clear the LZW table and start over at a smaller code size.
' This simple strategy produces significantly better results on extremely noisy images -

'This function was added by Tanner Helland (https://github.com/tannerhelland) for exploring dynamic
' LZW code table resets (in hopes of producing smaller GIF foiles).  There's not a lot of good
' scholarly research on this topic, but for an excellent overview of the general idea, see here:
'
' https://www.nayuki.io/page/gif-optimizer-java
'
'As for clearing the LZW table, nearly all GIF encoders take one of two approaches:
' 1) Clear the LZW table when it reaches maximum size, or...
' 2) Clear the LZW table 2 spaces before it reaches its first code size increase
'    (which produces a so-called "uncompressed" GIF - which despite the name, actually produces
'     smaller results than LZW itself when the input frame is extremely noisy)
'
'A "perfect" GIF encoder would actually work somewhere in-between these two mechanisms, filling the
' LZW table as long as it's helping compression, then clearing it whenever compression drops.
' Note that you also don't *have* to reset the code table when it reaches max size - in fact, on many
' images you may be able to eke out small gains by continuing to use the full code table as long as
' it produces "good" results.  (This is a quirk of LZW encoding, since a table clear also resets the
' compression ratio back to 1:1 until the table "jumps" a code size and starts beating out bare inputs
' again.)
'
'Anyway, the function below works fine, but I haven't cracked the logic necessary to really perfect
' a clearing strategy.  I've found it very hard to address outliers in particular - extremely
' compressible or extremely incompressible inputs - without hurting more normal images.  More work
' is needed!
