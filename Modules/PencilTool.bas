'Last update: split pencil tool into its own handler, as paint tools are about to get more complicated
'             (custom brush support!) and the pencil tool works *so* differently that it just clutters
'             up the paint module.
'
'PD's pencil tool is just a thin wrapper around standard GDI+ brushes.  For the good stuff, visit the
' Paintbrush module (which uses our own custom brushes for much more interesting effects).
