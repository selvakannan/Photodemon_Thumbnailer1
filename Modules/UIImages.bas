'Created: 13/July/18
'Last updated: 01/June/21
'Last update: rewrite against pdSpriteSheet, to reuse all the great optimization work I did there
'             as part of animation support (e.g. built-in compression support).
'
'PhotoDemon uses a *lot* of UI images.  The amount of GDI objects required for these surfaces is
' substantial, and we can greatly reduce requirements by using something akin to "sprite sheets",
' e.g. shared image storage for images with similar dimensions.
'
'At present, this module accepts images of any size, but it only provides a benefit when images are
' the *same* size - this allows it to automatically "coalesce" images into shared sheets, which callers
' can then access by index (rather than managing their own pdDIB instance).
'
'This module really only makes sense for images that are kept alive for the duration of the program.
' One-off images (e.g. temp images) should *not* be used, as it is non-trivial to release shared images
' in a performance-friendly manner.
'
'At present, PD limits usage of this cache to pdButtonToolbox images.  (They are the perfect use-case
' for shared caching.)

' entries are never duplicated, which is important as some images are reused throughout PD (for example,
' if every usage instance attempted to add that image to the cache, we would waste a lot of time and
' memory).  Note that the name is only required when *adding* images, so that we can perform a
' duplication check.  Once added, an image's handle is all that's required to retrieve it.
