'Last update: rework image unload wrappers to support new "automatic session restore after reboot" preference
'
'This module contains functions relating to the creation, sizing, and maintenance of the windows ("canvases") associated
' with each image loaded by the user.  At present, PD uses only a single canvas, on the main form.  This could change
' in the future.  This canvas is used to display the image on-screen, and its size is used to determine a number of
' viewport characteristics (such as whether or not scroll bars are needed to move around the image).
'
'Previously this module relied on internal VB measurements (like Form.ScaleWidth) when making viewport decisions.  With
' the fall '13 addition of floatable/dockable windows, and the full removal of MDI, it became necessary to rewrite much
' of this code against the program's new window manager (pdWindowManager class).  All calls to g_WindowManager relate
' to that class, which instead uses WAPI to return various window measurements.
