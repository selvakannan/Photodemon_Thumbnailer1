'Last update: fix nav key tracking across toolboxes (which are no longer unloaded after switching away
'             from them, but are kept in-memory for faster subsequent access)
'
'In a project as complex as PD, tab order is difficult to keep straight.  VB orders controls in the order
' they're added, and there's no easy way to modify this short of manually setting TabOrder across all forms.
' Worse still, many PD usercontrols are actually several controls condensed into one, so they need to manage
' their own internal tab order.
'
'To try and remedy this, PD now uses a homebrew tab order manager.  When a form is loaded, it notifies this
' module of the names and hWnds of all child controls.  This module manages that list internally, and when
' tab commands are raised, this module can be queried to figure out where to send focus.
'
'Similarly, this form automatically orders controls in L-R, T-B order, and because position is calculated at
' run-time, we never have to worry about order being incorrect!
'
'Finally, things like command bar "OK" and "Cancel" buttons are automatically flagged, so we can support
' "Default" and "Cancel" commands on each dialog.  Individual dialogs don't have to manage any of this.
