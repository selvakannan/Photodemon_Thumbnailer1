'Last update: fix cursor hotspot placement bug when creating cursors from resources
'
'Because VB6 doesn't provide many (any?) mechanisms for manipulating icons, I've had to manually write a wide variety
' of icon handling functions.  As of v7.0, all icons in PD are stored in our custom resource file (in a variety of
' formats, each one optimized for file size).  These icons are extracted, re-colored, resized (for high-DPI screens),
' and rendered onto UI elements at run-time.
'
'Menu icons currently lean on the clsMenuImage class by Leandro Ascierto.  Please see that class for details on how
' it works. (A link to Leandro's original project can also be found there.)
'
'This module also handles the rendering of dynamic form, program, and taskbar icons.  When an image is loaded and active,
' those icons can change to match the current image.  For an overview on how this works, visit this MSDN page:
