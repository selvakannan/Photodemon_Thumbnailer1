'
'This module interfaces between the gradient tool UI and pd2DGradient backend.  Look in the relevant
' tool panel form for more details on how the UI relays relevant fill data here.
'
'Most gradient shapes are rendered by internal, pure-VB6 renderers.  There are multiple reasons for this;
' 3rd-party libraries (GDI+, Cairo) don't support many of the gradient shapes, and even when they do,
' our internal renderers are often faster.  (This is especially true of Cairo, which is unfortunately
' slow across almost all gradient rendering modes.)
'
'The class is currently designed to use lookup tables for calculating actual gradient colors.
' This provides a ton of flexibility for future enhancements; for example, if in the future we want to
' implement something like blending colors in L*a*b* space, I simply need to change the lookup table
' generation code - the renderers themselves need no adjustment, as they just blindly pick colors
' from the lut.
'
'At present, colors are mixed in sRGB space, which is not really ideal.  Future enhancements will
' likely start here.  Adding jitter dither to the gradients themselves would also be a nice addition,
' although that *would* require some changes inside the renderers themselves.
