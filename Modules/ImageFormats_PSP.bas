'PhotoDemon PSP (PaintShop Pro) Container and Parser
'Copyright 2020-2024 by Tanner Helland
'Created: 30/December/20
'Last updated: 03/February/21
'Last update: wrap up finishing touches on export support
'
'This module (and associated pdPSP- classes) handle JASC/Corel Paint Shop Pro image parsing.
' All code has been custom-built for PhotoDemon, with a special emphasis on parsing performance.
'
'Both import and export of PSP files are supported.  I have attempted to support all possible
' versions of PSP files (PSP 5 was the version that "invented" the PSP format, and all versions
' since have made slight modifications to the format).  Unfortunately, Corel stopped publishing
' public specs for the PSP format after PSP 8, so support for all versions beyond that point relies
' on guesswork and heuristics instead of an authoritative "Spec".
'
'As with all 3rd-party PSP engines, Paint Shop Pro has many features that don't have direct analogs
' in PhotoDemon.  Many of these settings are still parsed by PD's PSP engine, but they will not
' "appear" in the final loaded image.  My ongoing goal is to expand support in this class as various
' PSP features are implemented in PD itself.
'
'Unless otherwise noted, all code in this class is my original work.  I've based my work off the
' "official" PSP spec at this URL (link good as of December 2020):
' ftp://ftp.corel.com/pub/documentation/PSP/
'
'Older PSP specs were also useful.  You may be able to find them here (link good as of December 2020);
' look for files with names like "psp8spec.pdf":

' the "warning" and "failure" values as flags; specific warning/failure states in each category will share
' the same high flag bit.)
