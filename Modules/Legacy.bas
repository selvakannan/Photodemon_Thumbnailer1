'Last update: migrate legacy functions from elsewhere to this dedicated legacy module
'
'PhotoDemon has existed for multiple decades!
'
'During that time, many (if not *all*) decisions have been revisited multiple times.
' Sometimes, major program features have even been scrapped or rewritten from scratch.
'
'Despite this, I try hard to ensure that any files created by PD are still useable even
' when those formats are reworked.  This module exists to collect legacy file format support
' functions.
'
'IMPORTANTLY: nothing in this module should be modified except to fix security issues or
' enable basic functionality.  Many of these functions are ugly and poorly constructed,
' and that's okay - I replaced them for a reason!
