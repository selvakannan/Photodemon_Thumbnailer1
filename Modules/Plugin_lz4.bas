'
'Per its documentation (available at https://github.com/lz4/lz4), lz4 is...
'
' "...a lossless compression algorithm, providing compression speed at 400 MB/s per core, scalable with
'  multi-cores CPU. It features an extremely fast decoder, with speed in multiple GB/s per core, typically
'  reaching RAM speed limits on multi-core systems."
'
'lz4 is BSD-licensed and written by Yann Collet, the same genius behind the zstd compression library.  As of
' Dec 2016, development is very active and performance numbers rank among the best available for open-source
' compression libraries.  As PD writes a ton of huge files, improved compression performance is a big win
' for us, particularly on old systems with 5400 RPM HDDs.
'
'lz4-hc support is also provided.  lz4-hc is a high-compression variant of lz4.  It is much slower
' (6-10x depending on workload), but provides compression levels close to zlib.  Decompression speed is
' identical to regular lz4, so it is a good fit for things like run-time resources, where you have ample
' time available during compression stages, but you still want decompression to be as fast as possible.
'
'As of v7.0, most internal PD temp files and caches are written using Lz4, so this library sees heavy usage
' during a typical session.
