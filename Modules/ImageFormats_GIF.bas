'Most image exporters exist in the ImageExporter module.  GIF is a weird exception because animated GIFs
' require a ton of preprocessing (to optimize animation frames), so I've moved them to their own home.
'
'PhotoDemon automatically optimizes saved GIFs to produce the smallest possible files.  A variety of
' optimizations are used, and the encoder tests various strategies to try and choose the "best"
' (smallest) solution on each frame.  As you can see from the size of this module, many many many
' different optimizations are attempted.  Despite this, the optimization pre-pass is reasonably quick,
' and the GIFs produced this way are often an order of magnitude (or more) smaller than a naive
' GIF encoder would produce.
'
'Note that the optimization steps are specifically written in an export-library-agnostic way.
' PD internally stores the results of all optimizations, then just hands the optimized frames off
' to an encoder at the end of the process.  Historically PD used FreeImage for animated GIF encoding,
' but FreeImage has a number of shortcomings (including woeful performance and writing larger GIFs
' than is necessary), so in 2021 we moved to an in-house LZW encoder based off the classic UNIX
' "compress" tool.  The LZW encoder lives in a separate module (ImageFormats_GIF_LZW).

    ' 1) The first pass handles most the pre-processing work.  It attempts to assemble a global (shared)
    '    palette for the image, which can be used by multiple frames.  If a frame's color requirements
    '    exceed the size limit of the global palette, the frame will get a local palette instead.
    '    Non-palette-related duties like frame cropping are also handled in this step, and frames with
    '    a local palette are fully optimized (because we know everything we need to know to optimize).
    ' 2) The second pass handles remaining optimization duties for frames that use the (now complete)
    '    global palette.  Because the full contents of the global palette may not be known until all
    '    frames are analyzed, we couldn't do optimizations like pixel-blanking on these frames yet.
    '    At the end of this pass, all frames are fully assembled, all frame properties are known,
    '    and the frames are ready to be dumped to file.
    ' 3) The final pass is the actual writing of the GIF file.  This pass is so fast that we don't
    '    bother using the progress bar for it.  (Even on an animation with hundreds of frames and a
    '    large total image size, this step typically occurs in <= 1 second.)
