'Last update: clean up code that converts animation frame times to/from layer names

'PhotoDemon was never meant to edit animations, but repeat user requests for animated GIF handling
' have led to a rudimentary set of import/export/playback features.  (Support has also been extended
' to a number of other animated formats, including APNG, WebP, JPEG XL, and possibly others.)
