'
'8bf files are 3rd-party Adobe Photoshop plugins that implement one or more "filters".  These are
' basically DLL files with special interfaces for communicating with a parent Photoshop instance.
'
'We attempt to support these plugins in PhotoDemon, with PD standing in for Photoshop as the
' "host" of the plugins.
'
'This feature relies on the 3rd-party "pspihost" library by Sinisa Petric.  This library is
' MIT-licensed and available from GitHub (link good as of Feb 2020):
' https://github.com/spetric/Photoshop-Plugin-Host/blob/master/LICENSE
'
'Thank you to Sinisa for their great work.
'
'Note that the pspihost library must be modified to work with a VB6 project like PhotoDemon.
' VB6 only understands stdcall calling convention, particularly with callbacks (which are used
' heavily by the 8bf format).  You cannot use a default pspihost release as-is and expect it to
' work.  (The pspihost copy that ships with PD has obviously been modified to work with PD;
' I mention this only for intrepid developers who attempt to compile it themselves.)
