'Module for handling all TWAIN32 acquisition features.  This module relies heavily
' upon the EZTW32.dll file, which is required because VB does not have native scanner support.
'
'The EZTW32 library is a free, public domain TWAIN32-compliant library.  You can learn more
' about it at http://eztwain.com/
'
'This project was designed against v1.19 of the EZTW32 library (2009.02.22).  It may not work with
' other versions of the library.  Additional documentation regarding the use of EZTW32 is
' available from the EZTW32 developers at http://eztwain.com/ezt1_download.htm
