'This module contains various image filters, but rewritten to work on single-channel byte arrays
' instead of three- or four-channel RGB/A images.  (In some cases, PD can use these filters for
' meaningful perf improvements over multichannel implementations - like operations on a mask.)
'
'Going forward, it would be nice to further expand this collection, but for now just know that
' the functions in this module cannot directly operate on images.  Also, they do not generally
' support progress bar reports (by design) as their emphasis is on raw performance.
