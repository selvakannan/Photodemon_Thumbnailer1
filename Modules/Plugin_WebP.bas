'Last update: add code for new libwebp dependency (libsharpyuv)
'
'Per its documentation (available at https://github.com/webmproject/libwebp/), libwebp is...
'
'"WebP codec: library to encode and decode images in WebP format. This package contains the library
' that can be used in other programs to add WebP support..."
'
'LibWebP is BSD-licensed and actively maintained by Google.  Fortunately for PhotoDemon, the developers
' also provide a robust C interface and legacy compilation options, enabling support all the way back
' to Windows XP (hypothetically - testing XP is still TODO).
'
'PhotoDemon historically used FreeImage to manage WebP files, but using libwebp directly allows for
' better performance and feature support, including animated WebP support (which do not work via FreeImage).
'
'Note that all features in this module rely on the libwebp binaries that ship with PhotoDemon.
' These features will not work if libwebp cannot be located.  Look in the pdWebP class for details
' on various APIs; they are all declared there.  (This module just provides basic library initialization
' and termination.)
