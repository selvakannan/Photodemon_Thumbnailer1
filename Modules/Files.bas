'Comprehensive wrapper for pdFSO (Unicode file and folder functions)
'Copyright 2001-2024 by Tanner Helland
'Created: 6/12/01
'Last updated: 18/March/22
'Last update: add additional pdFSO function wrapper(s)
'
'The pdFSO class normally provides Unicode file/folder interactions for PhotoDemon.
'
'But sometimes you just want to do something trivial - like see if a file exists - and instantiating
' a full class for this is unnecessarily verbose in VB.  Thus the purpose of this module: to provide
' fast access to pdFSO functions without you needing to worry about the details.
'
'If you need persistent interactions with a file, use pdFSO.  If you need one-off access to a
' particular file-related function, use this module.  (All calls end up at a pdFSO instance eventually.)
