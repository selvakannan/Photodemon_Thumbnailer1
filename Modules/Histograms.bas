'Last update: start collecting all of PD's various histogram-specific tools into a single location.

'Histograms pop up a lot in an image editor like PD, so rather than re-implement the same functions dozens of times,
' I've tried to condense key histogram functionality into this single module.
'
'Note that some UI code pops up here as well, as various PD tools provide a histogram overlay.
