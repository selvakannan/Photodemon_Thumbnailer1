'Deriche Gaussian convolution
' (original description by Pascal Getreuer)
'
'This routine performs Deriche's recursive filtering approximation of Gaussian convolution.
' The Gaussian is approximated by summing the responses of a causal filter and an anticausal
' filter. The causal filter has the form...
' f[H^{(K)}(z)] = \frac{\sum_{k=0}^{K-1} b^+_k z^{-k}}
'                    {1 + \sum_{k=1}^K a_k z^{-k}}
' ...where K is the filter order (2, 3, or 4). The anticausal form is the spatial reversal
' of the causal filter minus the sample at n = 0.
'
'The filter coefficients a_k, b^+_k, b^-_k correspond to the variables `c.a`, `c.b_causal`,
' and `c.b_anticausal`, which are precomputed by the routine Gaussian_DerichePreComp().
'
'Note: results may be inaccurate for large values of sigma unless double-precision values
' are used.
