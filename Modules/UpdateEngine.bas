'Automatic App Updater
'Copyright 2012-2024 by Tanner Helland
'Created: 19/August/12
'Last updated: 02/April/24
'Last update: rework to prep for a more rapid release schedule (using year.month version numbers)
'
'This module includes support functions for determining if a new version of PhotoDemon is available
' for automatic patching.
'
'IMPORTANT NOTE: this module doesn't do the actual updating (e.g. overwriting program files); it just
' CHECKS for updates.  Patching is handled by a separate exe.
'
'As of March 2015, this module has been completely overhauled to support live-patching of PhotoDemon
' and its various support files (plugins, languages, etc).  Various bits of update code have been moved
' into the new update support app in the /Support folder.  The use of a separate patching app greatly
' simplifies things like updating in-use binary files.
'
'Note that this code interfaces with the user preferences file so the user can opt to not check for
' updates and never be notified again. (FYI - this option can always be toggled from the 'Tools' ->
' 'Options' menu.)
'
'Unless otherwise noted, all source code in this file is shared under a simplified BSD license.
