'At present, this control is only designed for use on PD's primary canvas.  A few things to note:
'
' 1) High DPI settings are handled automatically.
' 2) Coloration is automatically handled by PD's internal theming engine.
' 3) Multiple measurement units are supported (px, in, cm - same as PD's resize dialogs and status bar)
' 4) Performance penalty of the current build is basically unmeasurable - a goal I'd like to maintain
'     through any future enhancements, as well!
