'PhotoDemon Unicode Text Box control
'Copyright 2014-2024 by Tanner Helland
'Created: 03/November/14
'Last updated: 09/February/16
'Last update: move all API edit control code out of this class, and into a dedicated pdEditBoxW class.  This greatly
'             simplifies this control, and we can reuse pdEditBoxW elsewhere.
'
'In a surprise to precisely no one, PhotoDemon has some unique needs when it comes to user controls - needs that
' the intrinsic VB controls can't handle.  These range from the obnoxious (lack of an "autosize" property for
' anything but labels) to the critical (no Unicode support).
'
'As such, I've created many of my own UCs for the program.  All are owner-drawn, with the goal of maintaining
' visual fidelity across the program, while also enabling key features like Unicode support.
'
'A few notes on this text box control, specifically:
'
' 1) Unlike other PD custom controls, this one is simply a wrapper to a system text box.
' 2) The idea with this control was not to expose all text box properties, but simply those most relevant to PD.
' 3) Focus is the real nightmare for this control, and as you will see, some complicated tricks are required to work
'    around VB's handling of tabstops in particular.
' 4) To allow use of arrow keys and other control keys, this control must hook the keyboard.  (If it does not, VB will
'    eat control keypresses, because it doesn't know about windows created via the API!)  A byproduct of this is that
'    accelerators flat-out WILL NOT WORK while this control has focus.  I haven't yet settled on a good way to handle
'    this; what I may end up doing is manually forwarding any key combinations that use Alt to the default window
'    handler, but I'm not sure this will help.  TODO!
' 5) Dynamic hooking can occasionally cause trouble in the IDE, particularly when used with break points.  It should
'    be fine once compiled.
