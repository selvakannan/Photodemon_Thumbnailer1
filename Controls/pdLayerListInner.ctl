'Last update: fix UI glitch when starting to move layer that is *not* the active layer
'
'In a surprise to precisely no one, PhotoDemon has many unique UI/UX needs - needs that the
' intrinsic VB controls can't handle.  These range from the obnoxious (lack of an "autosize"
' property for anything but labels) to the critical (no Unicode support).
'
'As such, I've created many of my own UCs for the program.  All are owner-drawn, with the
' goal of maintaining visual fidelity across the program, while also enabling key features
' like Unicode support.
'
'A few notes on this layer listbox control, specifically:
'
' 1) This control bares no relation to pdListBox, for better or worse.
' 2) High DPI settings are handled automatically.
' 3) A hand cursor is automatically applied, and clicks are returned via the Click event.
' 4) Color decisions are automatically handled by PD's internal theming engine.
