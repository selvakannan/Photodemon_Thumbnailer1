'Last updated: 16/August/20
'Last update: set scroll bar SmallChange property based on 1/2 height of items in the layer list box;
'             this makes for much faster scrolling when click-holding scroll up/down
'
'Unicode-compatible layer list box replacement.  Refer to the pdLayerListInner sub-control for additional
' details; it handles most the heavy lifting for this control.  (This control instance's only job is
' synchronizing the listview and scrollbar, as necessary.)
