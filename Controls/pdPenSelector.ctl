'This thin user control is basically an empty control that when clicked, displays a pen selection window.  If a
' pen is selected (e.g. Cancel is not pressed), it updates its appearance to match, and raises a "PenChanged"
' event.
'
'Though simple, this control solves a lot of problems.  It is especially helpful for improving interaction with the
' command bar user control, as it easily supports pen reset/randomize/preset events.  It is also nice to be able
' to update a single central function for pen selection, then have the change propagate to all tool instances.
