'In 7.0, a "color selector" panel was added to the right-side toolbar.  Unlike PD's single-color color selector,
' this control is designed to provide a quick, on-canvas-friendly mechanism for rapidly switching colors.  The basic
' design owes much to other photo editors like MyPaint, who pioneered various "wheel" UIs for hue selection.
'
'I've designed the control as a UC in case I decide to reuse it elsewhere in PD, but for now, it only makes an
' appearance on the main canvas.
