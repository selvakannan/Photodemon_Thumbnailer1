'PhotoDemon Toolbox Button control
'Copyright 2014-2024 by Tanner Helland
'Created: 19/October/14
'Last updated: 26/April/24
'Last update: raise custom drag/drop events (that the owner can respond to as they wish)
'
'In a surprise to precisely no one, PhotoDemon has some unique needs when it comes to user controls - needs that
' the intrinsic VB controls can't handle.  These range from the obnoxious (lack of an "autosize" property for
' anything but labels) to the critical (no Unicode support).
'
'As such, I've created many of my own UCs for the program.  All are owner-drawn, with the goal of maintaining
' visual fidelity across the program, while also enabling key features like Unicode support.
'
'A few notes on this toolbox button control, specifically:
'
' 1) Why make a separate control for toolbox buttons?  I could add a style property to the regular PD button, but I don't
'     like the complications that introduces.  "Do one thing and do it well" is the idea with PD user controls.
' 2) High DPI settings are handled automatically.
' 3) A hand cursor is automatically applied, and clicks are returned via the Click event.
' 4) Coloration is automatically handled by PD's internal theming engine.
' 5) This button does not support text, by design.  It is image-only.
' 6) This button does not automatically set its Value property when clicked.  It simply raises a Click() event.  This is
'     by design to make it easier to toggle state in the toolbox maintenance code.
