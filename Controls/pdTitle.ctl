'PhotoDemon Collapsible Title Label+Button control
'Copyright 2014-2024 by Tanner Helland
'Created: 19/October/14
'Last updated: 26/April/24
'Last update: raise custom drag/drop events (that the owner can respond to as they wish)
'
'In a surprise to precisely no one, PhotoDemon has some unique needs when it comes to user controls - needs that
' the intrinsic VB controls can't handle.  These range from the obnoxious (lack of an "autosize" property for
' anything but labels) to the critical (no Unicode support).
'
'As such, I've created many of my own UCs for the program.  All are owner-drawn, with the goal of maintaining
' visual fidelity across the program, while also enabling key features like Unicode support.
'
'A few notes on this "title" control, specifically:
'
' 1) Captioning is (mostly) handled by the pdCaption class, so autosizing of overlong text is supported.
' 2) High DPI settings are handled automatically.
' 3) A hand cursor is automatically applied, and clicks are returned via the Click event.
' 4) Coloration is automatically handled by PD's internal theming engine.
' 5) This title control is meant to be used above collapsible UI panels.  It auto-toggles between a "true" and
'     "false" state, and this state is returned directly inside the Click() event.
