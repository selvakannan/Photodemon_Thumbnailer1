'This control is currently used in the color selection dialog.  It provides a semi-owner-drawn mechanism
' for displaying an interactive "history" of items selected by the user (in the color selection dialog, for example,
' this is a list of colors selected by the user).  The user can click any item in the history to make it the
' "current" value.
'
'This control is best used in places where access to past values is useful, but only if it's available immediately
' (unlike a menu, where the user must navigate through discrete "layers" of an interface).
