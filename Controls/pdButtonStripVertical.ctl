'PhotoDemon "Button Strip Vertical" control
'Copyright 2015-2024 by Tanner Helland
'Created: 15/March/15
'Last updated: 29/April/20
'Last update: migrate renderer to pd2D
'
'In a surprise to precisely no one, PhotoDemon has some unique needs when it comes to user controls - needs that
' the intrinsic VB controls can't handle.  These range from the obnoxious (lack of an "autosize" property for
' anything but labels) to the critical (no Unicode support).
'
'As such, I've created many of my own UCs for the program.  All are owner-drawn, with the goal of maintaining
' visual fidelity across the program, while also enabling key features like Unicode support.
'
'A few notes on this button strip control, specifically:
'
' 1) The control supports an arbitrary number of button captions.  Captions are auto-wrapped, but DrawText requires word breaks to do this,
'     so you can't rely on hyphenation for over-long words - plan accordingly!
' 2) High DPI settings are handled automatically.
' 3) A hand cursor is automatically applied, and clicks on individual buttons are returned via the Click event.
' 4) Coloration is automatically handled by PD's internal theming engine.
' 5) When the control receives focus via keyboard, a special focus rect is drawn.  Focus via mouse is conveyed via text glow.
