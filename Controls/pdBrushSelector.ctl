'This thin user control is basically an empty control that when clicked, displays a brush selection window.
' If a brush is selected (e.g. Cancel is not pressed), it updates its appearance to match, and raises a
' "BrushChanged" event.
'
'Though simple, this control solves a lot of problems.  It is especially helpful for improving interaction
' with the command bar user control, as it easily supports brush reset/randomize/preset events.  It is also
' nice to be able to update a single central function for brush selection, then have the change propagate to
' all tool windows.
