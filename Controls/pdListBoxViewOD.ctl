'The list portion of a pdListBox object, with all drawing functionality provided as events that the parent control *must*
' respond to.  As with the default ListBoxView, the list view manages all the list data, and if no scroll bar is required,
' it is basically a fully functional listbox object.  If a scroll bar is required, however, you need to use the parent
' "ListBoxOD" control, which contains additional UI work for synchronizing against a scroll bar.
