'This thin user control is basically an empty control that when clicked, displays a gradient editor window.
' If a gradient is selected (e.g. Cancel is not pressed), it updates its appearance to match, and raises a
' "GradientChanged" event.
'
'Though simple, this control solves a lot of problems.  It is especially helpful for improving interaction
' with the command bar user control, as it easily supports gradient reset/randomize/preset events.  It is
' also nice to update a single central function for gradient selection, then have the change propagate to
' all tool instances.
'
'The actual gradient functionality of the control comes from the pd2dGradient class - look there for details.
