'Last update: switch to a pure path-based system for rendering and hit-detection
'
'In 7.0, a "color selector" panel was added to the right-side toolbar.  Unlike PD's single-color color selector,
' this panel is designed to provide a quick, on-canvas-friendly mechanism for rapidly switching colors.
'
'In particular, this "color variant" color selector provides a way to quickly "nudge" a color toward a nearby
' variants.  It uses an original design, which is always sketchy, but the goal here is to save the poor artist
' from needing to drop into a separate color dialog (at just about any cost!).
'
'I've designed the control as a UC in case I decide to reuse it elsewhere in PD, but for now, it only makes an
' appearance on the main canvas.
