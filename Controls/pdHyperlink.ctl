'PhotoDemon Unicode Hyperlink (clickable label) control
'Copyright 2014-2024 by Tanner Helland
'Created: 28/October/14
'Last updated: 18/April/16
'Last update: fix double-painting issue on MouseLeave events
'
'In a surprise to precisely no one, PhotoDemon has some unique needs when it comes to user controls - needs that
' the intrinsic VB controls can't handle.  These range from the obnoxious (lack of an "autosize" property for
' anything but labels) to the critical (no Unicode support).
'
'As such, I've created many of my own UCs for the program.  All are owner-drawn, with the goal of maintaining
' visual fidelity across the program, while also enabling key features like Unicode support.
'
'A few notes on this hyperlink control, specifically:
'
' 1) Unlike pdLabel, pdHyperlink does not support word-wrapping in any form.
' 2) High-DPI settings are handled automatically.
' 3) In its default configuration, this control does not raise any input-related events.  (Clicks are handled
'    internally, and they simply shell the associated URL property.)
' 4) As of March '15, this control exposes properties that allow it to expose a Click event, so the caller can handle
'    the event manually.
' 5) Coloration is automatically handled by PD's internal theming engine.
' 6) RTL language support is a work in progress.  I've designed the control so that RTL support can be added simply by
'    fixing some layout issues in this control, without the need to modify any control instances throughout PD.
'    However, working out any bugs is difficult without an RTL language to test, so further work has been postponed
'    for now.
