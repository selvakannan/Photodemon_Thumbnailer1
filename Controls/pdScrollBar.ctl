'Last update: switch to pdPopupMenu for right-clicks; this allows for localization (finally)
'
'In a surprise to precisely no one, PhotoDemon has some unique needs when it comes to user controls - needs that
' the intrinsic VB controls can't handle.  These range from the obnoxious (lack of an "autosize" property for
' anything but labels) to the critical (no Unicode support).
'
'As such, I've created many of my own UCs for the program.  All are owner-drawn, with the goal of maintaining
' visual fidelity across the program, while also enabling key features like Unicode support.
'
'A few notes on this scroll bar control, specifically:
'
' 1) Unlike traditional scroll bars, only a single "Scroll" event is raised (vs Scroll and Change events).  This event
'    includes a parameter that lets you know whether the event is "crucial", e.g. whether VB would call it a "Change"
'    event instead of a "Scroll" event.
' 2) High DPI settings are handled automatically.
' 3) A hand cursor is automatically applied.
' 4) Visual appearance is automatically handled by PD's central theming engine.
' 5) This control represents both horizontal and vertical orientations.  Set the corresponding property to match,
'     but be forwarned that this does *not* automatically change the control's size to match!  This is by design.
'     (Although I don't know why it would ever be wise to do this, note that you can technically change orientation
'      at run-time, without penalty, as a side-effect of this decision.)
