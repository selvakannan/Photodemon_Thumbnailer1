'This is PD's version of a "search box" - an edit box that raises a neighboring list window with a list
' of "hits" that match the current search query.  Search matching is left up to the parent window, which
' allows us to drop this control wherever we want without worrying about implementation details.
'
'This control is also very similar in construction to the pdListBox object, including its reliance on a
' separate pdListSupport class for managing its data.
