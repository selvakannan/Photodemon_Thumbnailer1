'PhotoDemon Image Strip control (e.g. a scrollable line of image thumbnails)

'Last update: delay resource loading until absolutely required
'
'In a surprise to precisely no one, PhotoDemon has some unique needs when it comes to user controls - needs that
' the intrinsic VB controls can't handle.  These range from the obnoxious (lack of an "autosize" property for
' anything but labels) to the critical (no Unicode support).
'
'As such, I've created many of my own UCs for the program.  All are owner-drawn, with the goal of maintaining
' visual fidelity across the program, while also enabling key features like Unicode support.
'
'A few notes on this image strip control, specifically:
'
' 1) At present, this control is only used by pdCanvas when multiple images are loaded.  Changes may be required
'     to make it work as a general-purpose image strip.
' 2) High-DPI settings are handled automatically.
' 3) A hand cursor is automatically applied, and clicks are returned via the Click event.
' 4) Coloration is automatically handled by PD's internal theming engine.
