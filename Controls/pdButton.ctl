'PhotoDemon Generic Button control
'Copyright 2014-2024 by Tanner Helland
'Created: 19/October/14
'Last updated: 01/April/24
'Last update: raise custom drag/drop events (that the owner can respond to as they wish)
'
'In a surprise to precisely no one, PhotoDemon has some unique needs when it comes to user controls - needs that
' the intrinsic VB controls can't handle.  These range from the obnoxious (lack of an "autosize" property for
' anything but labels) to the critical (no Unicode support).
'
'As such, I've created many of my own UCs for the program.  All are owner-drawn, with the goal of maintaining
' visual fidelity across the program, while also enabling key features like Unicode support.
'
'A few notes on this generic button control, specifically:
'
' 1) Captioning is (mostly) handled by the pdCaption class, so autosizing of overlong text is supported.
' 2) High DPI settings are handled automatically.
' 3) A hand cursor is automatically applied, and clicks are returned via the Click event.
' 4) Coloration is automatically handled by PD's internal theming engine.
' 5) This button cannot be used as a checkbox, e.g. it does not set a "Value" property when clicked.  It simply raises
'     a Click() event.  This is by design.
